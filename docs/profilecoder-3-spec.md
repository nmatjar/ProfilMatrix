## Section 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Professional Data Interchange (PDI) continues to evolve, demanding more nuanced and adaptive ways to represent individual professional attributes. ProfileCoder Version 3.0 builds upon the established foundation, introducing concepts of profile context, dynamic preferences, and enhanced interoperability for a more holistic representation of an individual's professional DNA.

This specification defines an enhanced "Adaptive Professional Profile" format, allowing for the encoding of not only static preferences but also contextual variations and the relative importance of different attributes. This evolution caters to the increasing complexity of modern work environments and the need for more sophisticated matching and personalization across various professional platforms.

A ProfileCoder Version 3.0 profile remains a data stream of well-defined segments, but now with the capability to include contextual information and preference weighting. The encoding continues to prioritize human readability and machine interpretability, facilitating seamless data exchange between a wider range of applications, including AI-powered career advisors, adaptive learning platforms, and dynamic team composition tools.

Version 3.0 further refines the clear-text encoding while introducing standardized mechanisms for representing preference salience and contextual applicability.

### 1.2 Scope

ProfileCoder Version 3.0 extends its scope to address the dynamic nature of professional preferences and the importance of context in various professional interactions. It acknowledges that individual preferences can shift based on the specific role, project, team, or organizational culture.

Building upon the comprehensive coverage of previous versions, Version 3.0 introduces capabilities for:

- **Contextual Preferences**: Specifying different preferences based on the situation (e.g., preferred communication style with clients vs. within the team).

- **Preference Weighting**: Indicating the relative importance or strength of different preferences.

- **Competency Integration**: Optionally linking preferences to specific professional skills and competencies.

- **Adaptive Profiling**: Supporting mechanisms for profiles to evolve based on experience and feedback (though the encoding itself remains declarative).

- **Standardized Vocabularies**: Promoting the use of standardized terms and ontologies for certain preference categories to enhance semantic interoperability.

The specification continues to be extensible, with a stronger emphasis on standardized extension mechanisms to ensure long-term adaptability and interoperability across diverse professional domains.

## Section 2: ProfileCoder Specification

### 2.1 Encoding Characteristics

#### 2.1.1 ProfileCoder Object

A ProfileCoder Version 3.0 object is a sequential collection of one or more segments, each dedicated to a specific category of professional preferences. The object begins with the first defined segment and concludes after the last. Each segment can optionally include a context identifier to specify the situation in which the enclosed preferences are most relevant.

#### 2.1.2 Property

Each segment comprises one or more properties. A property is defined as a key-value pair, where the key identifies a specific preference parameter, and the value represents the chosen setting or preference. In Version 3.0, property values can be associated with a weight indicating their importance, and context can also be specified at the property level.

#### 2.1.3 Delimiters

The ProfileCoder format utilizes the following delimiters to ensure clear parsing:

- **Segment Delimiter**: The "▪" character (Unicode: U+25AA) separates distinct segments.

- **Property Delimiter**: The ";" character separates individual properties within a segment.

- **Key-Value Delimiter**: The "=" character links a property key to its corresponding value.

- **Multiple Value Delimiter**: The "+" character indicates multiple selected values for a single property.

- **Sub-Value Delimiter**: The "," character (Unicode: U+002C) represents more complex values, such as ranges or structured sub-options.

- **Context Delimiter**: The "@" character (Unicode: U+0040) specifies the context for a segment or a specific property.

- **Weighting Delimiter**: The "^" character (Unicode: U+005E) indicates the weight or importance of a property value.

#### 2.1.4 Syntax

The general syntax of a ProfileCoder Version 3.0 object is as follows:

```
Category1[@Context1]{Key1=Value1^Weight1;Key2=Value2a+Value2b;Key3=Value3@SpecificContext^Weight2} ▪ Category2{Key4=SubValueA,SubValueB^Weight3;Key5=Value5} ▪ ...
```

- `Category1` and `Category2` are the emoji identifiers for the segment categories.
- `@Context1` is an optional text identifier for the context applicable to the `Category1` segment. If no context is specified at the segment level, the preferences are considered general or default.
- `Key1`, `Key2`, `Key3`, `Key4`, and `Key5` are the emoji identifiers for the properties within each segment.
- `Value1`, `Value2a`, `Value2b`, `Value3`, `SubValueA`, `SubValueB`, and `Value5` are the possible values for the respective properties.
- `^Weight1`, `^Weight2`, and `^Weight3` are optional indicators of the weight or importance assigned to the preceding value. The format and scale of the weight should ideally be defined in the Profile Metadata (📄) segment. If no weight is specified, a default weight (e.g., a weight of 1 on a 1-5 scale, or a "Medium" weight on a Low-Medium-High scale) is assumed.
- `@SpecificContext` applies the context "SpecificContext" only to the property `Key3` and its value `Value3`. This allows for property-level contextual variations within a segment that might have a broader segment-level context.

#### 2.1.5 Context

Context in ProfileCoder 3.0 defines the specific situation or environment in which certain preferences apply. Contexts allow for expressing different preferences for different situations, acknowledging that professional preferences often vary depending on circumstances.

Contexts can be applied at two levels:

1. **Segment-level context**: Applies to all properties within a segment
   ```
   👥@Team{👥=🙌^5;💬=📝^4}
   ```
   *All properties in this segment apply specifically to team interactions*

2. **Property-level context**: Applies to a specific property only
   ```
   📱{📱=💬^5;⏱️=⏰^3@Urgent^5}
   ```
   *Response time changes from same-day (importance 3) to immediate (importance 5) in urgent situations*

Common context types include:

- **Role-based**: @Management, @Individual, @Client, @Mentor
- **Activity-based**: @Meeting, @FocusWork, @Collaboration, @Presentation
- **Temporal**: @DeadlineWeek, @NormalOperations, @Crisis
- **Relational**: @Team, @Peer, @Reports, @Leadership
- **Project-based**: @ProjectX, @MaintenanceWork, @Innovation

The specific contexts used in a profile should be documented in the Profile Metadata (📄) segment, ideally referencing a standardized context vocabulary.

#### 2.1.6 Weighting

Weights in ProfileCoder 3.0 indicate the relative importance of preferences. This feature acknowledges that not all preferences hold equal importance to an individual or organization, and some may be non-negotiable while others are flexible.

Weights are specified using the "^" character followed by a weight value:

```
Key=Value^Weight
```

ProfileCoder 3.0 supports different weighting scales, which should be specified in the Profile Metadata segment:

1. **Numeric (default)**: 1-5, where 1 is least important and 5 is most important
   ```
   💼{👔=👕^2;🏢=🏠^5}
   ```
   *Remote work (5) is much more important than casual dress code (2)*

2. **Textual**: Low-Medium-High
   ```
   💼{👔=👕^Low;🏢=🏠^High}
   ```
   *Same meaning as above using text labels*

3. **Custom**: Any scale defined in the Profile Metadata

If a weight is not specified, a default middle value is assumed (e.g., 3 on a 1-5 scale, or Medium on a Low-Medium-High scale).

### 3.5 Profile Exchange Protocols

- Standardized APIs for profile exchange between different platforms and services.
- Selective sharing of profile segments based on context and privacy preferences.
- Mechanisms for profile validation and verification.
- Delta-based updates for efficient profile synchronization.
- Support for partial profile retrieval based on specific needs and permissions.

## Section 4: Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Context Management

Implementations should provide clear and flexible ways to define and manage contexts. Consider:

- Allowing users to create and name custom contexts.
- Pre-defining common professional contexts (e.g., "Team Meeting," "Individual Work," "Client Presentation").
- Using standardized vocabularies or ontologies (as referenced in the Profile Metadata) for enhanced interoperability.
- Enabling the application of context at both the segment and property levels.
- Implementing inheritance hierarchies for contexts (e.g., @Work.Meeting inherits from @Work).
- Providing visualization tools that allow users to easily switch between context views.

### 4.2 Weighting Schemes

A consistent and understandable weighting scheme is crucial. Implementations should:

- Define a clear scale for weights (e.g., numeric 1-5, textual Low-Medium-High).
- Communicate the meaning of different weight levels to users.
- Allow users to easily assign weights to their preferences.
- Consider providing default weights for unweighted preferences.
- Reference the weight scale used in the Profile Metadata segment.
- Convert between different weight representations using standardized algorithms when comparing profiles.
- Implement mathematically sound comparison operations for weighted preferences.

### 4.3 Data Processing for Context and Weight

Algorithms that process ProfileCoder Version 3.0 data should be designed to:

- Correctly parse and interpret context identifiers.
- Extract and utilize preference weights in comparison and matching logic.
- Handle cases where context or weight is not specified.
- Consider the context of both the target (e.g., a job description with contextual requirements) and the profile being evaluated.
- Implement fuzzy matching for weights to allow for preference flexibility.
- Calculate weighted compatibility scores that respect the relative importance of different preferences.
- Resolve conflicts between different contexts according to predefined priority rules.

### 4.4 User Interface for Context and Weight

The UI should make it easy for users to:

- Understand the concept of contextual preferences.
- Specify different preferences for various contexts.
- Assign weights to indicate the importance of their preferences.
- Visualize how context and weight influence matching or recommendations.
- Compare their own preferences across different contexts.
- See the aggregate impact of their weighted preferences on potential matches.
- Edit context-specific preferences without disrupting the general preferences.

### 4.5 Interoperability with Previous Versions

To ensure a smooth transition:

- Readers should be able to parse Version 1.0 and 2.0 profiles, treating all preferences as having a default weight and no explicit context.
- Writers might offer options to export profiles in previous version formats (without context or weighting) for legacy systems.
- Document any limitations or data loss when converting between versions.
- Implement version detection and auto-conversion capabilities.
- Provide graceful degradation for advanced features when interacting with systems supporting only earlier versions.

### 4.6 Standardized Context Vocabularies

To promote consistency and interoperability:

- Develop and publish standard vocabularies for common professional contexts.
- Include references to used vocabularies in the Profile Metadata segment.
- Support hierarchy and relationships between contexts (e.g., @Work > @Work.Meeting).
- Allow for domain-specific context extensions with clear namespacing.
- Implement validation mechanisms for context vocabularies.
- Provide tools for mapping between different context ontologies when necessary.

- Preserve the integrity of the original encoding, including all context and weight information.
- Correctly resolve contexts according to the specified inheritance rules.
- Apply appropriate default weights when not explicitly specified.
- Implement appropriate error recovery strategies for malformed profiles.

### 5.2 ProfileCoder Writer

A ProfileCoder 3.0 Writer must:

- Generate syntactically correct ProfileCoder objects according to the 3.0 specification.
