# ProfilMatrix Licensing Model

## Introduction

This document outlines the licensing approach for ProfilMatrix standard, the adaptive professional profile specification system. ProfilMatrix uses a dual licensing model to balance open adoption with sustainable development and commercial applications.

> **Note**: All versions of ProfilMatrix (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0) were developed simultaneously, with version 3.0 being the first and only officially published release. References to earlier versions are for feature-set differentiation rather than chronological releases.

Our licensing strategy aims to:
- Encourage widespread adoption and community contributions
- Protect the integrity of the standard
- Support ongoing development and maintenance
- Provide clear pathways for both non-commercial and commercial use
- Prevent patent litigation against adopters of the standard

## Dual Licensing Model

ProfilMatrix is available under two primary licensing options:

### 1. Open Source License

The core ProfilMatrix specification (basic features equivalent to the v1.0 feature set) is provided under the **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)**.

This license:
- Allows free use, modification, and distribution
- Requires changes to licensed files to be released under the same license
- Permits combining the licensed code with proprietary code
- Includes a patent license from contributors to users
- Allows sublicensing of proprietary modules that interact with the specification

The open source license applies to:
- Basic profile format specification
- Core segment categories documentation
- Formal BNF notation and parsing guidelines
- Example profiles
- Basic implementation guidelines

### 2. Commercial License

Advanced features of ProfilMatrix (equivalent to v2.0 and v3.0 feature sets, including context and weighting features) are available under commercial licensing terms directly from ProfilMatrix Consortium.

The commercial license:
- Enables proprietary implementations without MPL obligations
- Provides access to advanced features not included in the open source version
- Includes technical support and updates
- Permits redistribution under specified conditions
- Offers legal indemnification options

## Protection Strategies

### Patent License and Protection

ProfilMatrix licensing incorporates several mechanisms to protect users and contributors:

1. **Patent Non-Assertion Covenant**:
   - Users of any feature set of ProfilMatrix receive a covenant not to assert any ProfilMatrix Consortium patents essential to implementing the standard
   - This protection extends to both open source and commercial licensees

2. **Patent Retaliation Clause**:
   - All licenses terminate automatically if the licensee initiates patent litigation against the standard or its implementers
   - This provides protection against patent trolls and strategic patent litigation

3. **Patent Contribution Agreement**:
   - Contributors to the standard agree to license any essential patents under FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory) terms
   - Ensures the standard remains implementable without unexpected patent claims

### Fork Protection

The following measures are in place to maintain standard integrity while allowing innovation:

1. **Trademark Protection**:
   - The "ProfilMatrix" name and logo are registered trademarks
   - Only compliant implementations may use the ProfilMatrix branding
   - Certification program ensures quality of implementations using the brand

2. **Specification Versioning**:
   - Official versions are certified by ProfilMatrix Consortium
   - Clear compatibility requirements between feature sets
   - Migration pathways preserved for all feature levels

3. **Commercial Fork Limitations**:
   - Commercial forks must either:
     - Contribute innovations back to the main standard
     - License derivative standards under commercial terms from ProfilMatrix Consortium
     - Obtain explicit permission and potentially pay royalties
   - Different naming requirements for non-compliant forks

## Implementation and Certification

   - May use "ProfilMatrix Certified" badge

3. **Extended Conformance**:

   - Custom certification requirements
   - May use "ProfilMatrix Extended" branding

### Certification Process

3. Address any compliance issues
4. Receive certification documentation
5. Annual recertification for continued use of branding

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use ProfilMatrix in my open source project?**  
A: Yes, you can use the basic ProfilMatrix feature set under the MPL 2.0 license in any open source project. If you need advanced features, contact us about special licensing for open source projects.

**Q: Do I need a commercial license to use ProfilMatrix in my commercial product?**  
A: You can use the basic ProfilMatrix feature set in commercial products under the MPL 2.0 license. For advanced features like context-awareness and weighting, you need a commercial license.

**Q: Can I create extensions to the standard?**  
A: Yes. For private use, no restrictions apply. To publish extensions as part of the official standard, submit them to the ProfilMatrix Consortium for review. Commercial extensions may require licensing arrangements.

**Q: How is the standard governed?**  
A: The ProfilMatrix standard is governed by the ProfilMatrix Consortium, which includes founding members, corporate sponsors, and community representatives. The governance model ensures balanced representation from various stakeholders.

**Q: What happens if I modify the specification?**  
A: Under the MPL 2.0, modifications to the specification files must be shared under the same license. You may create proprietary implementations of the specification, but the specification itself remains open.

**Q: Why are there references to versions 1.0 and 2.0 if only 3.0 was published?**  
A: The version numbers refer to feature sets rather than chronological releases. All were developed simultaneously, but we use this terminology to clearly differentiate between basic, intermediate, and advanced feature sets for licensing purposes.
